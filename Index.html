            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>John Henry Irons aka Steel is a genius engineer who built a mechanized 
                suit of armor that replicates Superman's powers 
                and bears Superman's logo. Initially, he sought 
                to replace Superman after Superman was killed by
                 Doomsday. After Superman was resurrected, Superman 
                 accepted Steel as a comrade</p>
